# Welcome to my website!

Hello and welcome. My name is Anthony Nunnery and this is my webpage. I am currently a full-time research assistant at the Mandel School of Applied Social Science enrolled in the CWRU's School of Medicine Masters in Biostatistics program. In the future, this website will be a good way to connect with and follow me on my career journey. Thank you for your time and be well!
